How similar, in sequence and in structure, are SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

If we were to compare the sequences and structures of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, then we would conclude that the two strains are very similar in both aspects.

N.fasta.gsv is a fasta file containing 8 different sequences: Them being the first 4 hits of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 respectively. Needed to run the MSA.

The draft of the code shall be using MSA to compare the 8 different sequences and try to create a consensus sequence from them. The file shall also be trying to create a logo sequence to try to show the most used amino acids to show the similarities between the sequences. I will also be trying to use homology modeling/structural bioinformatics to compare between structures.
